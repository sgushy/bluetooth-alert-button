# bluetooth-alert-button

<p>Course project for ME 100 - Electronics for Internet of Things class. The intention of this project is to serve as a prototype for a wireless, smartphone-enabled personal alarm button. Usage such as to notify emergency services in case of an incapacitating fall.</p>

<p>This particular project, being my first using a microcontroller, was a breadboard prototype consisting of an ESP32, an MPU-9250 IMU, several buttons and LEDs. An internal state machine keeps track of the state of the system, with button presses changing the behavior. (Refer to the diagram)</p>
